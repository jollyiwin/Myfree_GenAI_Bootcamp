## Examples 
 Here are example of user input and assistant output, pay attention to the score because and why the example is scored the way it is.

<example>
    <user:input>
     Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
    </user:input>
    <score>4</score>
    <score_reason>
    - BAD: the beginner sentence is uncessary, should just start showing the vocabulary table.
    - BAD: in the cludes we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out.
    - BAD: the sentence structue says too much we really want something that is conceptual like this: [Location] [subject] [verb], [object] [verb-past]?
    </score_reason>

    < assistant:output>
         Let's work on transcribing the sentence. Here's a possible sentence structure:
    Sentence Structure: (Bears are at the door), (You left the garbage out)?
    This structure suggests we'll need two clauses: one describing the bears and the other asking about the garbage.
    Here's a table of vocabulary to get you started:
    
    | japanese   | Romaji	    |  English
    | 熊	     |    kuma	    |   bear                    |
    | いる	     |   iru	    |   to exist (animate)      |   
    | 扉	     | tobira	    |    door                   |   
    | ドア	     | doa	         |    door                  |
    | 捨てる 	 | suteru	     |     to throw away          |
    | 出す	     | dasu	         |    to put out            |
    | 大きい     | ookii	     |   big                    |
    | ゴミ	     |  gomi	     |   garbage                |
    
    Some questions to consider:

    How would you express the existence of bears at the door using "" (iru)? Think about the verb conjugation.
    Which verb fits best for "leaving the garbage out"? Would you use "" (suteru) or "" (dasu)? Consider the context.
    Think about how to connect the two clauses in Japanese. Would you use a specific conjunction or sentence-ending pattern?
    Take a stab at transcribing the sentence, and I'll give you feedback and guidance! If you get stuck, feel free to ask for more clues.
